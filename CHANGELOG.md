# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Added
- `@storybook/html-webpack5` as the Storybook framework (manager + standard preview)
- Atom stories: `Hello`, `World`
- Molecule story: `Greeting` — composes Hello + World with a live `name` arg control
- `src/relay.js` — Express + WebSocket relay server (port 3333) that bridges Storybook's preview to external meta-preview clients
- `.storybook/preview.js` (storybook-channel) — decorator that captures rendered story HTML and sends it to the relay after each render
- `public/meta-preview.html` — standalone meta-preview page; connects to relay via WebSocket and re-renders the active story live
- `yarn dev` — runs relay and Storybook concurrently via `concurrently`
- Dynamic hostname resolution in storybook-channel so the relay connection works from any machine on the network
